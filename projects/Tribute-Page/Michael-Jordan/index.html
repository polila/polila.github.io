					<h1>"Air Jordan"</h1>
					<p>In his first MVP season, Jordan created one of the best All-Star moments ever by taking off from the free-throw line in the Slam Dunk contest against Dominique Wilkins. It was a revelation that pushed the boundaries by atesting that dunking from the free-throw line was even possible.</p>

					<h1>"The Move"</h1>
					<p>In Game 2 of the 1991 Finals against the Lakers, Jordan pulled off what has become one of his most famous highlights -- the up-and-under, swooping layup in the lane. Jordan ended the night with 33 points on 15-of-18 shooting (making 13 in a row at one point), along with 13 assists, seven rebounds, two steals and a block. Chicago would win Game 2 and win the series in five games.</p>

					<h1>"Be Like Mike" Campaign</h1>
					<p>The Gatorade campaign began after Jordans' 1991 MVP season concluded, which debuted in August during the year of '91. But Jordan’s second MVP season – and his first title with the Chicago Bulls – spawned the "Be Like Mike" commercial, which has become <a href="https://news.nike.com/news/jordan-brand-gatorade-collection" target="_blank" style="color: #FF8C00;">iconic</a> to modern pop culture.</p>

					<h1>Jordan taunts Mutombo</h1>
					<p>Jordan was a superb trash talker and loved to play mind games on the court, which was evident in November ’91, when he pulled a funny stunt on the great Dikembe Mutombo. Near the end of a Bulls victory, Mutombo was bantering with Jordan while MJ was at the free-throw line. Jordan laughed and said, 'This one’s for you,' before closing his eyes and draining the free throw. It’s one of MJ’s most memorable moments.</p>

					<h1>'92 Playoffs: Game 3 (vs. Heats)</h1>
					<p>In Game 3 of the first round of the '92 playoffs, Chicago had a chance to close out Miami on the road. Was Jordan going to let that chance pass? Nope. He dropped 56 points on the Heat, along with five rebounds, five assists, four steals and two blocks. Watching performances like this, you can understand why Jordan began to think, 'The NBA is too easy for me. Let's go play professional baseball instead <a href="https://www.livestrong.com/article/365378-michael-jordans-baseball-history/" target="_blank" style="color:	#787878">(Chicago White Sox).'</a></p>

					<h1>'92 Playoffs: Game 7 (vs. Knicks)</h1>
					<p>After taking out the Heat in ’92, Jordan faced the Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinals and was pushed to the limit. In Game 7, Jordan countered Patrick Ewing’s 22 points and John Starks’ 18 with 42 of his own, including six rebounds and four assists. -- It was step two of a completely dominant postseason for MJ.</p>

					<p>Step three -- not including defeating Cleveland in the Eastern Conference finals -- was the ’92 Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers, which included a top-three MJ moment: The Shrug. In Game 1 against the Blazers, Jordan dropped 35 in the first half (ended with 39).</p>

					<h1>Father's Day</h1>
					<p>Jordan won his fourth NBA title on Father’s Day 1996 in his first full season back from retirement. We remember it because of the backstory. Part of the reason Jordan retired was to cope with his <a href="http://graphics.chicagotribune.com/james-jordan-murder/index.html" style="color: #8B0000;" target="_blank">father’s murder</a> and pursue the baseball dream he had always shared with his dad. An emotional Jordan collapsed in tears after the game, providing one of the most poignant moments of his career.</p>

					<h1>"The Last Shot"</h1>
					<p>With a little more than five seconds left in Game 6 (NBA series are best of 7) of the '98 finals, Jordan crossed over Utah’s Bryon Russell and sank a jumper to give the Bulls the lead and clinch MJ’s sixth championship with Chicago. It’s widely regarded as the best shot Jordan ever made.</p>

Regardless, he ended game 5 with 38 points and a clutch 3 pointer in the final 25 seconds of the 4th quarter!</p>
